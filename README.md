# Acme Bank - Secure Views

Welcome to the Acme Bank project's views directory! This section focuses on the user interface components, with a strong emphasis on security and code quality.

## Security Measures

This project employs several defensive JavaScript techniques to mitigate common web vulnerabilities:

*   **SQL Injection Prevention:**  Input validation and sanitization are implemented to prevent malicious SQL queries.
*   **XSS Attack Prevention:**  Data escaping and output encoding are used to neutralize cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Path Traversal Protection:**  Strict path validation is in place to prevent unauthorized file access.
